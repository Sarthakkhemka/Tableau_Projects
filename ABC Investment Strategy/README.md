# ABC Investment Analyses

## OVERVIEW:

ABC & Co is an investment banking firm and they are planning on their next big investment. The company plans on investing $500 million in one of the growing private comapnies in the US market. The managers want to analysze the top 5000 private comnapnies in the US and find which Industry their investment would have the best ROI. 

In this project I analyzed a data set for the top 5000 Private Companies in the US to find out the different competition across Industries and States. I also looked into the highest revenue grossing industries as well as the relationship between Growth and revenue across the industry. I used **Tableau** to analyze the data and created an interactive dashboards.

From the Map above we can find out that the state with the most number of Private Companies is California and the state with the least is Alaska.

This Graph brings us insight into each industry. The graph has been placed in an descedning order, the industry in the top having the highest revenue. As a resuslt we can see that Health, Energy and IT services are the top 3 Industries by Revenue. However we can also see that the largest company by revenue, Pacific Union Real Estate is not a part of either of the three industries but part of the Real Estate Industry. 

## CONCLUSION:

In Conclusion, Even though Energy is one of the smallest industry in terms of the number of participants/comapnies, it is the second largest industry in terms of revenue. This means that the participants in the industry experience low levels of competition and a s a result can enjoy a larger share of the revenue. If we look into the growth chart for the industry we can see that the Energy industry sa top 10 growth rates which provides an idea for the future of the industry. 

As a result ABC & Co should look into investing in the Energy Industry becasue the scope of growth and also becasue of lack of competition.
